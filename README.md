# wire-ios-transport

This framework is part of Wire iOS SyncEngine. Visit [iOS SyncEngine repository](http://github.com/wireapp/zmessaging-cocoa) for an overview of the architecture.

The wire-ios-transport framework abstracts the network communication with our backend. It handles authentication of requests, network failures and retries transparently.

### How to build

This framework is using Carthage to manage its dependencies. To pull the dependencies binaries, `run carthage bootstrap --platform ios`.

You can now open the Xcode project and build.
